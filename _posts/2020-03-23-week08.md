title: Week 7.5(8) - Spring Break
---

## Contributing
  This past spring break we haven't had class so I thought, what better what to spend it than trying to contribute to some open source. I am definitely behind in contributing, but after doing so it is actually quite fun. I contributed to open food facts. I updated some of the foods with more facts and listed out all their ingredients. I added an item in of which they did not have in stock and uploaded more pictures. I'm going to try to contribute to Open Food Facts at least once every two days and see how I can make other small contributions to Wiki and Open Maps. I also need to figure out how to list my contributions from my website to my blog page.


## Group Project Plans

  We have been discussing within our groups and are still on the fence of doing Open Food Facts or My Free Code Camp. I am definitely leaning towards Code Camp because they are mainly JavaScript oriented however, they have guide for other language which in my opinion is more versatile. If we did open food facts, which is almost entirely HTML, something I am not too comfortable in, I feel that I would not be able to apply myself as much. I plan on discussing this with my group member this coming monday and making a final decision. 
  
  Hope you enjoyed reading my week 8 post all. See you all next week!
