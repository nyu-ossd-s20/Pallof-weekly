title: Week 14 - Week 6 of Zoom and Final Presentations
---

For this week we are just having our final presentations for class. I have finished up my two pull requests the first one fixing some instructions issues regarding mongoDB and how to set up a basic database to store your files. The second one was regarding the basic fundamentals of computer science using getter and setters. I had to change up a lot of the inner documentation trying to re-explain what these properties do while also changing the example code. Overall this was very eye opening.
I hope to be able to contribute more to open source in the future outside of class.

Hope you enjoyed reading this weeks blog post! Thank you for keeping up to date with me!
