When I hear the words open source, to me it sounds like a collaborative proeject in which everyone or anyone can contribute to. These projects are typically very vast and aim to target specific issues in the tech industry. However open source does not neccesarily mean that everyone can just used the code as they please due to licensing rights. While closed source is software contributed to by a community but it's closed off to the public to see and change. Some of the advantages to open source are a costs, service, and innovation where the more people you have joining a project the workload will become less. The downsides are security and usability. I wanted to register for this course because I have never worked in open source development and believed that this class would be a great way to get my foot in the door and really be hands on.


I've never directly worked with any open source projects and have ever truly had to use any, however during the winter I was helping a friend with his project which was an API for NYU albert. I did a lot of reading on ReactNative for his project.
