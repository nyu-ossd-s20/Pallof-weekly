For our group extension we did a lot of reading up on about how Mozilla works and how extensions can be useful. We learned how to implementvey basic extensions at the beggining of class. Even though they were just simple icons and border changes, it was really interesting to see how if more work was put in, you could create something extremely fancy. For our extension idea, we plan on making a color/border changer for specific colors to better represent NYU and their colors. We have locked down the idea and just need to finish up the code to implement it. I'm confident we will have it done by the due date and be ready to present in class. I've definitely learned many things about mozilla and the practical uses for it!
