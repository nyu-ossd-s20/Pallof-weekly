title: Week 13 - Week 5 of Zoom and further progression on FCC
---

This week we had a short presentation of where everyone updated what their plans were moving forwards with their projects and their progress. Everyone has been making good progress and has been making pull requests. Our wednesday class ended up being canceled due to personaly reasons. Our group has made 2 more pull requests for FCC and we are planning to present on wednesday (5/6/2020). I have made 2 pull requests so far, but going to try to squeeze one more in. This has honestly been a eye opening experience for me and I think I will continue to contribute to FCC and find some other OS projects that I want to contribute to.

Thank you again for reading this weeks blog!

Some of the things I want to contribute to possibly:
RuneLite
