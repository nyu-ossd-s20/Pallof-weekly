title: Week 10 - Week 3 of Zoom and further project progression
---

This week of zoom classes we had everyone give a brief 5 minute presentation on the projects that they are working on and the progress they have made so far. Most groups have made progress such as getting the dev environments working and starting to create minor pull requests here and there. Many groups are working on very interesting projects and its very cool to see students making contributions to large projects. It feels as if we are part of something bigger than what we are just coding when we get labs from our classes. 

Our group had some issues last week where the issues we had tried to tackle were solved or marked as duplicate. This caused us some delays because we had taken a while to find issues in of which we though were doable and more so to our skill level. We also were surprised b/c these issues had been open for a while and were suddenly closed or had a pull request made from someone who asked to work on the task over 2 months ago. However, we were able to find a bunch of new issues rather quickly and have already put our names down and gotten approval from the upper admins to take a swing at them. We hope we quickly fix these issues and start creating a coding challenge. In the meantime we are also doing some looking at COVID-19 projects, mostly for fun but they are definitely cool to take a peek at. 

Thank you again for reading my blog post!
