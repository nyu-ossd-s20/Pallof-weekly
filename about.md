Here some cool facts about myself!
My name is Daniel Sing and I am currently a senior studying Econ/Computer Science. I used to swim competitively for NYU and enjoy playing frisbee. If you ever want to play ultimate frisbee, you are more than welcome to join my friends and I. 
### More Information

I enjoy the outdoors from hiking to just having a nice picnic.
